        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pray to god that your employer lets you have some time off to go
                buy an Ultimeatum from the truck.
            </li>
            <li>If that fails, try to sneak away and buy the burger while your
                boss isn't looking.
            </li>
            <li>
                If that fails, create clones of yourself to try and convince your
                boss into thinking you're working, so that you can sneak off
                and buy an Ultimeatum.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the clones are evil, beat them up so you can eat your Ultimeatum
                in peace.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your boss eats your Ultimeatum after your epic face-off against
                your evil clones, <strong>CRY FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER AND</strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
